What and Why?

Roulette Go will be a webapp that helps friends and groups pick what to do for the evening. It will have multiple categories where the user can pick what outing they want. For example, if they need help picking a movie or a dinner location the app will help randomize local places according to their preferences taken in a little quiz. This webapp will take the weight off of indecisive groups that can not seem to make a decision for the evening. It adds new activites that groups might not have partaken in and it will have a calendar sync feature that will add the event to the group's individual calendars.

For who?

It would be catered to indecisive friend groups. For example, a group of coworkers want to go out for dinner and they can not come to a decision on where they should go. They would be able to go on Roulette Go and pick the category they are having trouble deciding on, in this case dinner, and the app will give a quick questionnaire of any preferences and allergies in this case. It will then scan local places that fit the prefrences, if any, and pick a place for them. If the user decides that they do not like the decision made then they can spin again. 

How?
1) All members of the group have to create an account
2) Create a group
3) Pick the category/event type (if the group does not know then there will be a roulette feature with some ideas for a hangout)
4) Fill out quick questionnaire which will depend on what the event is
5) Play roulette
6) If the option is good with everyone in the group they can RSVP and it will sync to their calendars

Scope

Roulette Go is a well enough balanced project for the semester with a group of 4-6 programmers.
The concepts the app covers is:
- User friendly UI
- Account creation and Authentication
- Randomizer Algorithms
- Event Database
- Location-based Recommendations
- Calendar syncing
With these varied concepts and features the project proves to be appropriate for 4-6 programmers with a time frame of a semester.
